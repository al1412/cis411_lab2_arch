# Step 1: Confirm Lab Setup
- [X] I have forked the repository and created my lab report
- [X] I have reviewed the [lecture / discsussion](../assets/04p1_SolutionArchitectures.pdf) on architecture patterns.
- [X] If I'm collaborating on this project, I have included their handles on the report and confirm that my report is informed, but not copied from my collaborators.

# Step 2: Analyze the Proposal
Serve Central helps its users to find volunteer work through a mobile application, with all registration for a volunteer position being done on one application as opposed to the long and often inconsistent registration process most volunteer positions have. Additionally, Serve Central provides a map of volunteer work that is nearby to the user, as well as how far each one is relative to their current location, and a description of each activity, making it easier for the user to narrow down their options for the work they wish to pursue.    

## Step 2.1 Representative Use Cases  

| Use Case #1 | |
|---|---|
| Title | Opening Central Service app for the first time |
| Description / Steps | 1. The user first sees the welcome page, then should click the sign up button on the page. 
2. The user sees the sign up page, in which they fill out information such as their name, email address, and password. 
3. After this, the user should click the submit button at the bottom of the page, which leads them to a confirmation page confiriming that the information has been sent.  
4. After getting to the confirmation page, the user should check their email for a confirmation message, then click the link in that email to log into Central Service.
5. After logging in, the user should be directed to the main page of the Central Service website for the location which they are volunteering at. |
| Primary Actor | Volunteer |
| Preconditions | Have an account through central service, have location feature enabled |
| Postconditions | User gets confirmation email, information is sent to registar upon completion of application, the app is updates the number of volunteers at a location |

# Step 3: Enhancing an Architecture

## Step 3.1 Architecture Change Proposal
INSERT Architectural change proposal here, and how it meets the two new requirements.  Explain both the benefits and draw backs of your proposal.

## Step 3.2 Revised Architecture Diagram
INSERT IMAGE HERE with a Description.

# Step 4: Scaling an Architecture
INSERT Architectural change proposal here, and how it meets the four new requirements.  Explain both the benefits and draw backs of your proposal.  If the changes are significant, then you need to explain why the changes are necessary versus a nice-to-have enhancement.
